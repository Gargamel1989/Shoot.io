/* Socket.IO server set up. */

        //5b2ca132-64bd-4513-99da-90e838ca47d1
        //and store this on their socket/connection
        player.id = UUID();
        player.userid = player.id;

        //tell the player they connected, giving them their id
        player.emit('connected', { id: player.userid } );

        //now we can find them a game to play with someone.
        //if no game exists with someone waiting, they create one and wait.
        game_server.findGame(player);

        //Useful to know when someone connects
        console.log('\t :: socket.io\t:: player ' + player.userid + ' connected');
        

        //Now we want to handle some of the messages that clients will send.

        //When this client disconnects, we want to tell the game server
        //about that as well, so it can remove them from the game they are
        //in, and make sure the other player knows that they left and so on.
        player.on('disconnect', function () {
